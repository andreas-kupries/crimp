A bit on the design.
====================

My plan is to implement only the bare functionality at the C level,
with a multitude of simple commands, and each command handling only a
specific image type, or combination of types. The proper API to the
functions is then done in Tcl, making changes to option processing,
automatic selection of a function, etc. easy to code, and change.

See http://wiki.tcl.tk/2520 (A critical mindset about policy), which
summarizes to "No poli-C, please", or, slightly longer, "Policy issues
must be scripted".

As a simple example, consider the operation ot invert images.

	We will have one command for each image type supporting the
	operation. Currently we have three, one each for rgb, rgba,
	and grey8. The API is then a single invert procedure which
	queries the type of its argument and then dispatches to the
	proper low-level command, or throws an error with a nice
	message.

	Now any changes to the error message can be done by easy
	editing of the Tcl layer, without having to recompile the C
	level.

Similarly for importing from and exporting to files/channels/tk,
conversion between types (where sensible or possible), etc.

Side note:
	Writing the Tcl layer should become easier the more uniform
	the syntax of the underlying group of commands.


Operations done and under consideration
=======================================

[]	write - Export a crimp image to other formats.

	[]	write_grey16_tk
	[]	write_grey32_tk
	[done]	write_grey8_tk
	[done]	write_rgb_tk
	[done]	write_rgba_tk

[]	read  - Import crimp images from other formats.

	[done]	read_tk

[]	convert - convert between the various crimp image types.

	[]	convert_hsv_grey16
	[]	convert_hsv_grey32
	[]	convert_hsv_grey8
	[done]	convert_hsv_rgb
	[done]	convert_hsv_rgba	- see the notes on rgb_rgba below. essentially apply here as well.

	[]	convert_rgb_grey16
	[]	convert_rgb_grey32
	[done]	convert_rgb_grey8
	[done]	convert_rgb_hsv
	[]	convert_rgb_rgba	- set opaque alpha, or transparent, or via grey image ?
					- could be done as split/join

	[]	convert_rgba_grey16   - Like grey8, or should we expand to cover whole range ?
	[]	convert_rgba_grey32   - S.a.
	[done]	convert_rgba_grey8    - Standard luma transform (ITU-R 601-2)
	[done]	convert_rgba_hsv
	[]	convert_rgba_rgb

[]	invert - invert colors

	[]	invert_grey16
	[]	invert_grey32
	[done]	invert_grey8
	[]	invert_hsv	- How is inversion defined in this colorspace ? (*)
	[done]	invert_rgb
	[done]	invert_rgba

	(*)	I am speculating that the HUE would rotate by 180 degrees.
		I have no idea if VALUE or SAT should change as well,
		in a similar manner.

[]	split - split the input image into its channels, i.e.
		RGBA into 4 images, one each for R, G, B, and A.
		Etc. for the other types.

	[done]	split_rgba
	[done]	split_rgb
	[done]	split_hsv

[]	join - join multiple grey scale images into a multi-channel
	       (colorized) image. Complementary to split.

	[done]	join_rgba
	[done]	join_rgb
	[done]	join_hsv



[]	blend   - Z = A*(1-alpha)+B*alpha   - alpha is scalar
[]	compose - Z = A*(1-ALPHA)+B*ALPHA - alpha is grey8
	?	- Z = TOP*(1-alpha(TOP))+BOTTOM*alpha(TOP) - alpha from top image.
	== bring these together into single command group.

	lighter	       Z = max(A,B)
	darker	       Z = min(A,B)
	difference     Z = |A-B|
	multiply       Z = (A*B)/255
	screen	       Z = 1-((1-A)*(1-B))
	add	       Z = A+B
	subtract       Z = A-B

	// The above is a group of composition/merge operations

	stencil - apply a mask - could be 'set alpha channel'
			       - but also 'set black outside mask'
			       (blue/green screen techniques)

RGB [0..1] --> CIE XYZ [0..1] (Y = luminosity)

|X|      1      |0.49    0.31    0.2    |   |R|
|Y| = ------- * |0.17697 0.81240 0.01063| * |G|
|Z|   0.17697   |0       0.01    0.99   |   |B|

ITU-R BT.709 is different
|X|             |0.412453 0.357580 0.180423|   |R|
|Y| =           |0.212671 0.715160 0.072169| * |G|
|Z|             |0.019334 0.119193 0.950227|   |B|

While the official definition of the CIE XYZ standard has the matrix
normalized so that the Y value corresponding to pure red is 1, a more
commonly used form is to omit the leading fraction, so that the second
row sums up to one, i.e., the RGB triplet (1, 1, 1) maps to a Y value
of 1.

Chromacity:	S = X+y+Z, x=X/S, y=Y/S, z=Z/S

Yxz - Represent luminosity and chromacity.
