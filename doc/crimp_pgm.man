[description]

This package provides commands for the conversion of CRIMP images to
Portable Greymaps (PGM) and vice versa.

[para] For a basic introduction of the whole CRIMP eco-system please
read the [term {CRIMP - Introduction to CRIMP}] (sic!).

The basic concepts used here, like images, image types, etc. are
described in the reference manpage for the [term {CRIMP - Foundation}].
We will not repeat them here, but assume that the reader knows them
already.

[para] In the overall architecture this package resides in the middle
layer of the system's architecture, between core and applications, as
shown at

[para][image arch_pam][para]

[para] The commands it provides all fall into the I/O category of the
general design.

[call [cmd ::crimp] [method {read pgm}] [arg string]]

This method extends the [cmd {::crimp read}] ensemble. It takes the
(possibly binary) string holding an image in the PGM format and
returns an image of type [const rgb] containing it.

[call [cmd ::crimp] [method {write 2string}] [arg format] [arg image]]
[call [cmd ::crimp] [method {write 2chan}]   [arg format] [arg chan] [arg image]]
[call [cmd ::crimp] [method {write 2file}]   [arg format] [arg path] [arg image]]

The package extends the above ensemble with support for the following formats

[list_begin definitions]
[def [const pgm-plain]]

The plain ASCII format of portable grey maps, as per
[uri http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format].

[def [const pgm-raw]]

The raw binary format of portable grey maps, as per
[uri http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format].

[list_end]

[para] The supported image types are [const grey8], [const rgb],
[const rgba], and [const hsv].
